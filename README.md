## 👋😁 Howdy! my name's Ryan, but I also go by Code-Contempory here on Github.

### A Little About Me:
- I've been familiar with code since 2015, but never took programming seriously and challenged myself to build any projects of decent scale until now.
- I studied math and computer science at the junior college level and hold an Associate's in Math and Science.
- I hold a Bachelor's in Mass Communication and Media Studies because I like tech journalism, but decided to pursue software development as a career instead.
- I am currently pursuing a second degree, followed by a Master's in Computer Science, in order to work in the field of data engineering or application security.
- I love working with new technologies, and am particularly fond of anything that involves geographical data.
